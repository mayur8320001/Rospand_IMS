# Accounting Process Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the accounting processes implemented in the Rospand IMS system. The accounting module provides comprehensive financial tracking and reporting capabilities integrated with the warehouse management system.

## Core Accounting Concepts

### 1. Ledgers
Ledgers are the foundation of the accounting system. Each ledger represents a specific account category:
- **Assets**: Resources owned by the company (Cash, Bank, Inventory)
- **Liabilities**: Obligations owed by the company (Loans, Accounts Payable)
- **Income**: Revenue generated by the business (Sales, Service Income)
- **Expenses**: Costs incurred in business operations (Rent, Utilities, Salaries)

### 2. Transactions
All financial movements are recorded as transactions in the system. Each transaction:
- Is associated with a specific ledger
- Has a monetary amount
- Is classified as either Debit or Credit
- Includes a narration for context
- Is timestamped

### 3. Double-Entry Bookkeeping
The system implements double-entry bookkeeping principles:
- Every transaction affects at least two accounts
- Total debits must equal total credits
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity

## Accounting Processes
